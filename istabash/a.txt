# type -a ls
# env: shows all env variables on the system

chmod u+x bash

echo $PATH:shows the values in env variable path
create variable:
name=james (without space)
get value of name:
echo $name
echo hello $name
data +%A 
echo today is d=data + %a
d=(date +%A)
this is correct: d=$(date +%A)
today is $d 
today is $(date +%A)
redirect output too a file:
today is $(date +%A) > ab.txt
standard out put number is 1 and error is 2
 to redirect errors to another  file:
 ls /* 1>aa.txt 2>error.txt
 to putt  both in the same place:
ls /* 1> all.txt 2>&1
line counter: wc -l tow.txt
do in one line:
ls -l | wc -l > two.txt
